# Info related to CAD files

### There are two approaches taken to achieve the target stated in the problem statement

* This CAD folder contains two sub-folders, Main Model and Alternate Model
* Main Model contains the design of a 6-DOF robotic arm in .stp format on which all the simulations and testings have been performed
* Alternate Model contains the design of a robotic arm associated with artificial muscles for tough robotic applications in .stp format as a part of innovation of the project
